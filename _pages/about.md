Hi there, I'm Sudan Pandey

I am a Ph.D. candidate in civil engineering at the University of Arizona.

My current research focuses on steel seismic collector connections Seismic collectors and their connections are crucial in transferring the inertial force from the floor or roof diaphragm to the vertical components of the seismic force resisting system during a seismic event. My research involves conducting physical testing of large scale collector connection at NHERI Lehigh and analytical studies using ANSYS, all aimed at enhancing our understanding of collector behavior and design practices.

# Research Interests
My research interests are in the seismic and wind engineering. I would like to contribute in making our build environment resilient. I have a work experience in performance based seismic design and wind tunnel testing of high rise buildings.


# Selected Experience
I have two years of work experience in a performance based seismic design.

I have three years of experience with wind tunnel testing of high rise buildings.

I have four years of experience in teaching. I have taught and TA's various courses like Steel Design, Statics, Mechanics of Solids, and Civil Engineering Materials Lab in civil engineering.
