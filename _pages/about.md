Hi there, I'm Sudan Pandey

I am a Ph.D. graduate at the University of Arizona.


I am currently working on steel seismic collectors, which are crucial in transferring the inertial force from the floor or roof diaphragm during a seismic event to the vertical components of the seismic force resisting system. My work involves conducting physical testing of large scale model in the lab and analytical studies using the finite element software, all aimed at enhancing our understanding of collector behavior and design practices.

# Research Interests
My research interests are in the seismic and wind engineering. I would like to contribute in making our build environment resilient. I have a work experience in performance based seismic design and wind tunnel testing of high rise buildings.


# Selected Experience
I have two years of working as a performance based seismic design engineer.

I have three years of experience with wind tunnel testing of high rise buildings.

I have four years of experience in teaching. I have taught and TA's various courses like Steel Design, Statics, Mechanics of Solids, and Civil Engineering Materials Lab in civil engineering.
