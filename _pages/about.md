Hi, I’m **Sudan Pandey**.

I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering (Structural Engineering)** at the **University of Arizona**. My research focuses on the **seismic performance of steel collector connections**, combining **large-scale experiment** and **advanced numerical modeling** to improve seismic design practice.

Seismic collectors and their connections are critical components that transfer inertial forces from floor and roof diaphragms to the vertical elements of the seismic force-resisting system during earthquakes. My current research work includes **large-scale testing of collector connections at the NHERI Lehigh facility** and **high-fidelity finite element modeling using ANSYS**, aimed at enhancing understanding of collector behavior under extreme seismic demands.


## Research Interests
- Seismic behavior and design of **steel collector connections**
- **Nonlinear modeling**, analysis and design
- Large-scale **testing** and validation of **numerical models**
- **Performance-based seismic design (PBSD)** of building structures
- **Wind engineering** and **Wind resistant design** of tall buildings

## Selected Experience
- **Graduate Research Assistant (2020–2026):** Multi-university research on seismic collectors, nonlinear modeling, structural analysis and design, and large-scale testing  
- **Industry Experience:** Performance-based seismic design of tall buildings using **PEER TBI, LATBSDC, ASCE 7, ASCE 41, and ACI**  
- **Wind Engineering:** Wind tunnel testing and post-processing for high-rise buildings  
- **Teaching:** Behavior and Design of Structural Systems, Steel Design, Statics, Mechanics of Solids, and Materials Laboratory Testing

## TECHNICAL SKILLS
