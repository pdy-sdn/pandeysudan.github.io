Hi there, I'm Sudan Pandey

I am a Ph.D. graduate at the University of Arizona.


I am currently working on steel seismic collectors, which are crucial in transferring the inertial force from the floor or roof diaphragm during a seismic event to the vertical components of the seismic force resisting system. My work involves conducting physical testing of large scale model in the lab and analytical studies using the finite element software, all aimed at enhancing our understanding of collector behavior and design practices.
