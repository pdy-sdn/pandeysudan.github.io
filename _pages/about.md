Hi there, I'm Sudan Pandey

I am Ph.D. graduate student at the University of Arizona.

I am currently working on steel seismic collectors, which are crucial in transferring the inertial force from the floor or roof diaphragm during a seismic event to the vertical components of the seismic force resisting system.
