Hi, I’m **Sudan Pandey**.

I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering (Structural Engineering)** at the **University of Arizona**. My research focuses on the **seismic performance of steel collector connections**, combining **large-scale experimental testing** and **advanced numerical modeling** to improve seismic design practice.

Seismic collectors and their connections are critical components that transfer inertial forces from floor and roof diaphragms to the vertical elements of the seismic force-resisting system during earthquakes. My work includes **large-scale testing at the NHERI Lehigh facility** and **high-fidelity finite element modeling using ANSYS**, aimed at enhancing understanding of collector behavior under extreme seismic demands.
