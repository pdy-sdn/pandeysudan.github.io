Welcome to my experince page! Here I highlight my research projects during my Ph.D. at the University of Arizona, as well as industry projects I worked on at AIT Solutions, Thailand.

## Research Projects: 
## Steel Seismic Collector Connections

During my Ph.D., I conducted large-scale experimental testing of steel seismic collector connections and performed high-fidelity nonlinear simulations in ANSYS. The goal was to understand the behavior and performance of collector connections under seismic loads.  

### Highlights:

- Large-scale physical testing at NHERI Lehigh
- 3D and 2D finite element modeling in ANSYS
- Validation of models against experimental data
- Parametric studies to evaluate collector connection performance

## Cast Steel Joints

### Highlights:

- 3D and 2D finite element modeling of welded joints between cast steel and HSS sections using ANSYS
- Failure prediction using ductile fracture index and void growth index
- Low cycle Fatigue (LCF), High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) testing of welded joints
- Prequalification of welded joints between cast steel and mild steel HSS
- Crack growth in cast steel joints
- Modeling of cast steel material gradient properties

## Industry Projects: AIT Solutions, Thailand

At AIT Solutions, I worked on **performance-based seismic design** of tall buildings and **wind tunnel testing** for high-rise structures.

### Highlights:

- **Seismic design using Perform-3D and ETABS**
- **Wind tunnel testing:** HFFB, cladding pressure, and pedestrian wind comfort
- **Post-processing using MATLAB for design recommendations**
