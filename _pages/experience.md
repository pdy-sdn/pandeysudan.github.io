Welcome to my experience page! Here, I highlight my research projects completed during my Ph.D. at the University of Arizona, as well as performance-based design (PBD) and wind engineering projects I worked on at AIT Solutions, Thailand.

## Research Projects

## Steel Seismic Collector Connections

This research is part of a large multi-university project led by the **University of Arizona (UA)** in collaboration with **Lehigh University** and the **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)**, and funded by the **National Science Foundation (NSF)**. The primary objective of this research is to advance knowledge on the seismic performance, analysis, and design of collectors in steel buildings with composite floor and roof systems.

The work involves both computational simulations and large-scale experimental testing. I was directly involved in large-scale experimental testing of steel seismic collector connections, as well as the associated analytical work.

### Highlights

- Large-scale experimental testing at **NHERI Lehigh**
- 3D and 2D finite element modeling in **ANSYS**
- Validation of numerical models against experimental data
- Parametric studies to evaluate collector connection performance

## Cast Steel Components for Building Construction

I worked on the **Cast Steel Components for Building Construction** research project led by **Dr. Robert B. Fleischman** at the **University of Arizona**, funded through an **SFSA DID project**. The research combined computational simulation with extensive physical testing.

My role included conducting **monotonic tension testing**, **low-cycle fatigue (LCF) testing**, and **high-cycle fatigue (HCF) testing**, along with the analytical work required to interpret and support the experimental results.

### Highlights

- 3D and 2D finite element modeling of welded joints between cast steel and HSS sections using **ANSYS**
- Failure prediction using ductile fracture index and void growth index
- Low-cycle fatigue (LCF) and high-cycle fatigue (HCF) testing
- Prequalification of welded joints for cast steel components
- Crack growth modeling

## Industry Projects: AIT Solutions, Thailand

At **AIT Solutions**, I worked on **performance-based seismic design** of tall buildings and **wind tunnel testing** for high-rise structures.

### Highlights

- Performance-based seismic design using **Perform-3D** and **ETABS**
- Wind tunnel testing: **HFFB**, cladding pressure, and pedestrian wind comfort studies
- Post-processing and data interpretation using **MATLAB** for design recommendations
