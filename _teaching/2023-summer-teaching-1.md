In this course I taught a group of senior Undergraduate students. This course is a fundamental course in engineering mechanics.
Statics deals with the bodies at rest and forces in equilibrium. The primary goal is to teach student to draw free body diagram,
calculate forces on rigid bodies by using fundamental laws and concepts.
