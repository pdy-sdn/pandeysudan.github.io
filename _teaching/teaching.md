## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy is grounded in clarity, engagement, and real-world relevance. I strive to help students develop a strong conceptual understanding of structural behavior while also building confidence in applying engineering principles to practical problems. I emphasize clear communication, active problem-solving, and the connection between theory, design codes, and real structural systems. Drawing from my research and industry experience, I aim to create a classroom environment where students understand not only *how* to solve a problem, but *why* a particular engineering decision is made.
